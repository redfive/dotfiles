# dotfiles
Home directory dotfiles focused on a Bash setup on Ubuntu Linux

The basic layout for this dotfile repo and the way the functionality works is based on @holman's dotfiles here: https://github.com/holman/dotfiles. As his setup is focused on zsh and (it appears) Mac OSX, I haven't forked his repo but have been picking and choosing what to pull in.
